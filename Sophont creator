lookup table for non-human player characters

Start with a vaugley humanoid character. You'll modify this.
Roll one d6 to choose the table you are looking at, roll a second d6 to see what option from that table you get.
Do this twice. you now have those two cliche(1) or a single cliche(2).
eg

PLAYING A HUMAN - if you insist on a species trait for being human, they are Endurance(1) and Throwing Stuff(1)

Question - are you looking to have a family, a village, beliefs, language? Wrong place. 
Question - are you looking for an extra edge, Mr Half Ork? Wrong place
These results are meant to be for people wanting a different flavour, not tons of salt.

Hot city setting for gunpoweder fantsy using Risus Reduced format.

This will be a brutal game. It is advised to roll 2-3 characters. "The quicker it is to create a character... the more ok it is to be lethal because the player can roll up another character and be back in the game quickly."			

# Character creation 
Start with 5 xp. The below rules can be used to make a character, and also carry out upgrades during sessions. There are more examples below.

spend 1xp to add 1 dice to any cliche() for your current career				
 No starting cliche should be over 3. Example: Blather(3) is ok. You can only reach Blather (4) after earning xp in the game. 

spend 1xp to add any +bonus word (and a dice) to any cliche already earned from other careers				

spend 1xp to change career to any connected or the six starter ones.				



Arkanopolis is a big city with peoples, races and species from all over the world mixing. Think fever dreams of Constantinople.
As such, you may (optionally) at creation spend 1xp to get two Species cliches based on your different body. (see https://github.com/cromlyngames/Arkanopolis---risus-death-funnel/blob/master/Sophont%20creator) 
		
				
# Examples of character and career progression				
				
/roll 1d6; to pick start career				
If I rolled 4 counting across the starters, that gets me the Beggar. 				
'  	Abel 
  	Night Vision (1)  - 1xp
  	change career to Thief - 1xp 
  	Move Silent(2) - 2xp
 	Climbing(1) - 1xp '
or a second Beggar Character could be 				
'  	Bernard the Artful Dodger 
  	Social Invisibility(3) 
  	Survival(2)		'		
				
BONUS WORDs+				
@patbrry rolled *1* for another starting career				
Outcast. Mwah hah hah! 
'  	Charmine the hunchback 
  	Pet Vermin - pet crow (2) 
  	Privy to Secrets (3)	'			
spending 1xp like that always gets you an extra dice, it's for when that cliche isn't available anymore, as well as if you just want a diseased pet crow				
eg Charmine the Wizard (two careers later) might still have Pet Crow(2)				
She could boost it by adding Arcane to get Arcane Pet Crow(3)				
or Pet Crow of the Tower(3)				
				
# Example with non-human species		
I choose to spend 1xp to get two species cliches at creation				
'/roll 1 d6 and /roll 1d6				
I rolled 1 and then 5, getting Danger Sense (1)				
/roll 1 d6 and /roll 1d6				
I rolled 4 and 5, getting Redundant Organs(1)				
I rolled a 1 to pick start career, getting Outcast.				
I spend 1xp to move straight to Rat Catcher				
I put 2xp into Hypnotism(2)				
I put 1xp into bonus word Musical+		
Final Character: Stermin the Banshee		
	Danger Sense(1)	
	Musical Redundant Organs(2)	
	Hypnotism(2)	'

# Example with merging cliches
Where reasonable a good GM will allow a player to merge cliches.
Jakob is a Demagogue with Friends(2), Brawling(1) from previous careers as a Servent than an Innkeeper.
He spends 1xp to get the Deamagogue cliche Followers and Friends(1)
It is totally reasonable to merge the Friends(2) in too, giving him a Followers and Friends(3), Brawling(1)
Another example is an Rat-Catcher turned alchemist merging Poisons(2) into Potions and Poisons()

Less clear examples might be merging Navigation() and Wayfinder() or Ettique() and Diplomancy(). If it makes the game interesting and the player happy, allow it.
